## [4.12.0] - 2025-04-24

### Changed

- Changed default to use Baselibs v7.33.0

## [4.11.0] - 2025-04-07

### Changed

- Revert to using `large` resource class for the build job (was doubling costs unnecessarily)

## [4.10.0] - 2025-02-25

### Changed

- Changed default to use Baselibs v7.32.0

## [4.9.0] - 2025-02-07

### Changed

## [4.7.0] - 2025-01-15

### Changed

- Changed default to use Baselibs v7.29.0

## [4.6.0] - 2024-12-18

### Changed

- Move to Ubuntu 24 images/executors by default

## [4.5.0] - 2024-11-29

### Changed

- The build job now defaults to the `xlarge` resource class. It was found `ifx` jobs required more memory.

## [4.4.0] - 2024-11-19

### Changed

- Updated ifx executor to use Intel 2025.0 and Intel MPI 2021.14

## [4.3.0] - 2024-11-07

### Added

- Added new `remove_pfunit` option to the build job to remove PFUnit from the build (allowing testing of an edge case in MAPL)

## [4.2.0] - 2024-10-31

### Changed

- Update to use GCC 14.2 and Open MPI 5.0.5 for gfortran executors

## [4.1.0] - 2024-10-28

### Changed

- Changed default to use Baselibs v7.27.0

## [4.0.0] - 2024-08-23

Note: This is a major version bump due to the change from `intel` to `ifort` and `ifx` executors.
So older v2 based CI will need to change their `.circleci/config.yml` to use the new executors.

### Added

- Added new `ifx` executor as we transition from `ifort` to `ifx`

### Changed

- Changed the `ifort` executor to use newly named Docker images
